## About the project
This work introduces a method for safely navigating a Self-driving vehicle to avoid obstacles and reach its destination in highway scenarios using a combination of deep Q Networks (DQN) and neural networks (NN). DQN is trained in simulation to serve as a
central decision-making unit using Q value functions for actions estimating future rewards and then finding the optimal solution that proposes targets for a trajectory planner. As the
self-driving car task involves making decisions based on sensor inputs and navigating through a complex environment, NN allows the Agent (virtual car) to learn a mapping from
raw sensor inputs to action outputs facilitating effective decision-making. After continuous training through exploration and exploitation, the self-driving car was able
to reach its destination successfully without hitting any obstacles, demonstrating that the suggested method is capable of safe and efficient driving.
